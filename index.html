<h2>Step Four: Learn to use Editing Software</h2>
<p>There are many different types of software out there, with many different price ranges. Some software may require high monthly payments, however it is possible to get away with using free software when you are first starting out.

<h2>Step Five: Build a Portfolio</h2>
<p>When someone is looking to hire a photographer, they are interested in previous work they have done, to make sure they are making the right choice. It may be wise to ask friends or family to star in your photos, or take pictures at public events, to build a resume for yourself before seeking out any potential clients.

<h2>Step Six: Find your Niche</h2>
<p>While it is good to be a well-rounded photographer, it is always good to find what you enjoy the most, and even specialize in certain areas of photography (portrait, wedding, sport, landscape, etc).

<h2>Step Seven: Give your Clients What They Want</h2>
<p>Remember that photography is a business, and while you my want to put your own personal flare on it, the client may not like it as much. If you give the client exactly what you want, they are most likely going to enjoy the product and recommend you to others.
